# Bigger Buffs for Blizzard's Raid Frames

World of Warcraft addon.

This adds hooks to wow's raid frames (aka "CompactUnitFrame") in order to tweak
buff indicator behavior. A tiny hack I've wrote and now have been using for several years.

In order to understand what we are hooking, look for and download a copy of the base
wow UI code, knows as "FrameXML".
